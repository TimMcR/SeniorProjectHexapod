# Description
I repurposed a robotic hexapod for my High School as my senior project. I reprogrammed the leg movement and kinematics as well as the controls for a PS2 controller. 
I would bring the project to many different community outreach events, including multiple times at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans. 
I even got to show it off to New Orleans Pelicans player Frank Jackson for a Smoothie King Center commercial. 
Eventually I got tired of using the PS2 controller and reprogrammed the hexapod to be controlled through blue-tooth controls on an iPhone instead. 
To replace the physical joysticks I programmed it so the phone's accelerometer controlled the robot movement.
